Hotel Deals Project

For this project I choose to work with Java and MVC design pattern, they tow of the most I am familiar with.

Starting from the JSON Response it is easy to decide the one basic unit model " Offer", to filter the offers we have
one controller that implement the search action, requesting the appropriate API, processing the JSON Object to store
a list of offers that is set on the request as an Attribute, then displayed on the view page using jstl.  

If there is other things to be added I wish if a set of validators are implemented to check a set of request parameters and 
a small selenium code to test the site. Also I wish if I could present the deals in more appealing way.
